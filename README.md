# Hi, I'm Diego! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Software Developer, passionate for discovering, researching and applying new technologies, so that my personal projects are of use to anyone who shares the same excitement for learning and creating scalable and elegant applications. The technologies I find the most fulfilling to use include Java, Spring Boot and JavaScript. 
For the purpose of establishing myself as a competent Backend Developer, I'm improving my knowledge on the production of APIs, their uses and interaction with streamline deployments on Docker.
